# ProTraApp March 2nd 2021 concept

## Program Traveler Application

### Desc:

ProTraApp (**Pro**gram **Tra**veler **App**lication) is a set of libraries used to creatively link 2 programs of the same universe together. Mainly a game engine plugin, it can also be used for other software and programs.

A library for programs and video games that link multiple parts of multiple apps in the same universe together. Some common uses would be if Clash of Clans had an arena structure. ProTraApp would then be enabled to link this to open Clash Royale (and prompt to install)

I have had this idea for quite some time (at least 2 years) but I didn't publish it until today
