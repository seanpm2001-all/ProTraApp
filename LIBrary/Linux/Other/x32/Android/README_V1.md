# ProTraApp for Android 32 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 bit versions of Android (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 bit support for Android 1.5 Donut to Android 4.4 KitKat. Support for Android 1.1 is not added at the moment, as it is not important enough, and it is hard to find data for versions below 1.0.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. Java

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)

32 bit support for Android 5.0 and up is not happening until after 2038, as I want to help encourage more users to switch to 64 bit UNIX before the [Year 2038 problem occurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) simply switching to a 64 bit system is the solution for this problem (note: does not affect Windows users, as Windows is not UNIX Based, but it does affect MacOS. 32 bit Windows has its own problems, like the Year 10000 bug, and 32 bit Windows is becoming less and less common, so it shouldn't be an issue there)
