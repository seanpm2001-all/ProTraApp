# ProTraApp for Ubuntu 32 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 bit versions of Ubuntu (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 bit support for Ubuntu 4.10 to Ubuntu 15.10

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)

32 bit support for Ubuntu 16.04 and up is not happening until after 2038, as I want to help encourage more users to switch to 64 bit UNIX before the [Year 2038 problem occurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) simply switching to a 64 bit system is the solution for this problem (note: does not affect Windows users, as Windows is not UNIX Based, but it does affect MacOS. 32 bit Windows has its own problems, like the Year 10000 bug, and 32 bit Windows is becoming less and less common, so it shouldn't be an issue there)
