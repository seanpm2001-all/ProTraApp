# ProTraApp for Windows 10

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows 10 (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 and 64 bit support for Windows 10 build 1507 to build 2004. Since the script is pretty universal, it will work on Java 5 and above (and possibly earlier versions)

Due to the nature of Windows 10, languages are currently more diverse, as I am not entirely sure how to differentiate at the moment.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C#

2. Java

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
